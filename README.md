# search-decrapify

This local extension automatically loads google's search results page in "web" mode by appending "udm=14", hopefully de-emphasizing AI-centric search features.

If you find this helpful, please consider making a one-time donation to UNRWA (https://donate.unrwa.org/one-time/~my-donation) or any other charity of your choice 🙏

## Installation

1. Download the repository as a zip file (green "code" dropdown menu in upper right corner)
2. Open the chrome extensions page (three dots menu --> extensions).
3. Activate "developer mode" (toggle in top right corner).
4. Click "load unpacked" (top left).
5. Navigate to the unzipped extension folder and select it.
6. Done!
